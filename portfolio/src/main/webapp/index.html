      <h1>Anthony Sanchez</h1>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      </p> You may be wondering how I ended up here.</p>
      <p>It all started when I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. As a child, growing up in a neighborhood surrounded by violence I quickly realized that my education would be key to better things for both me and my family. Getting accepted and attending SUNY Stony Brook University was one of my major accomplishments. As a Mechanical Engineering major, I quickly learned that I was no longer satisfied with my choice of career path. I knew there more out there, more that I could do to reach my full potential.</p>
      <p>I decided to take a year off from school while I searched for what it was that I was missing to fill in the gap between myself and what my purpose was. Funny how life works, Computer Science wasn’t a career I put much mind to it to say the least, but if it wasn’t for switching classes very last minute that introduced me to programming, I wouldn’t have made the discovery that led me to find something that I enjoy most.</p>
